well my problems only lie in the fact that i havent been able to get my game to work 
most of the red tags that i had i fixed but in my code the public class and the actuale class are named wrong i named i orb and the other ords  witch i did not realiz after a whiele
then i needed all the code from the orb class we made but trueitt helped me so in the end i still  have no errors but im still not sure on how to make and place a hitbox around the
 orb
