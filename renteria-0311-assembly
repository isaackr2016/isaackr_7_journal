assembly i a low leavle program that is tedous and error prone but unlike java thought it thought it only uses the needed code and give direct control ove writing device drivers ,
 operating system desing and embeddded system programs 
a hight level language like java is portable and can change to adaped to machinre like the aduieno boards and is reltivly easy to code with few lines whiel a low level language
 like c++ i difcult and more of words than codes it is extremaly tedious and error- prone in my experence.
