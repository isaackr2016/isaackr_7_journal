i wanted to create a game the had a big map and you could omly see soo far as if you where in the dark and you would go thought fighting monster looking for the exit
i couldent even get ymy game past the example i couldent even play the example on my computer 
i did thought sole alot of errors on it so my game wasent covered in red 
befor winter breake i was able to make a map and look at the spritsheets and make charters but i didnt know how to import it so i could use it in the game 
in the end i had the idea and most of the material but i couldent make the game because i had majior problems with my code
